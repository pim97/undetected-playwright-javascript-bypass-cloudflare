# Playwright JavaScript CF Solver

This repository contains a JavaScript script that sends a POST request to an API, extracts the cookie and user agent, and uses Playwright to set these cookies and user agent in a browser session while navigating to a specified URL through a proxy.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 12+
- [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro) for JavaScript
- Required Node.js packages (listed in `package.json`)

## Code example

```javascript
const { chromium } = require('playwright');
const { getCookiesAndUserAgent } = require('./lib/scrappey.js');
require('dotenv').config();

const API_KEY = process.env.API_KEY;
const PROXY_URL = process.env.PROXY_URL;
const TARGET_URL = process.env.TARGET_URL;

(async () => {
  const { cookieObject, userAgent, proxyObject } = await getCookiesAndUserAgent(API_KEY, TARGET_URL, PROXY_URL, 126, 'chrome');

  const browser = await chromium.launch({ proxy: proxyObject, headless: false });
  const context = await browser.newContext({
    userAgent: userAgent
  });
  await context.addCookies(cookieObject);

  try {
    const page = await context.newPage();
    await page.goto(TARGET_URL);
    
    await page.waitForSelector('body');
    await page.screenshot({ path: 'screenshot_chrome.png' });

  } catch (e) {
    console.error(`Exception occurred: ${e}`);
  } finally {
    await browser.close();
  }
})();
```

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/pim97/undetected-playwright-javascript-bypass-cloudflare.git
    cd repo-name
    ```

2. **Install the required packages:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Install Playwright browsers:**

    ```bash
    npx playwright install
    ```

## Usage

1. **Set your API key and proxy URL:**

    Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add your API key, target URL, and proxy details:

    ```env
    API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
    TARGET_URL=https://example.com
    PROXY_URL=http://user:pass@host:port
    ```

2. **Run the script:**

    ```bash
    node script.js
    ```

    This will execute the script, sending a POST request to the API, extracting the cookie and user agent, and using Playwright to set these cookies and user agent in a browser session while navigating to the specified URL.

## Script Breakdown

- **Step 1:** Send a POST request to the API and extract the cookie and user agent from the response.
- **Step 2:** Parse the target URL to extract the domain.
- **Step 3:** Use Playwright to launch a browser, set the extracted cookie and user agent, and navigate to the specified URL through the provided proxy.

### Functions

- **`parseCookieString(cookieString)`**: Parses the cookie string into a list of cookie objects.
- **`getCookiesAndUserAgent(apiKey, targetUrl, proxyUrl, version, browserName)`**: The main asynchronous function that sends a request to the API, retrieves cookies and user agent, and returns them along with proxy settings.
